This library corresponds to the "Neural Linear Bandits: Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting through Likelihood Matching" paper, that was anonymously submited to NeurIPS 2019.

The code is based on the "Deep Bayesian Bandits Showdown: An Empirical Comparison of Bayesian Deep Networks for Thompson Sampling" github repository https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deep_contextual_bandits, published in ICLR 2018.

All the data sets can be found in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php, and should be placed in the datasets folder. 

The code requires to install TensorFlow, and cvxpy.
